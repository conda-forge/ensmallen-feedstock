  summary: ensmallen is a C++ header-only library for mathematical optimization.
  description: |
    ensmallen provides a simple set of abstractions for writing an objective 
    function to optimize. It     also provides a large set of standard and 
    cutting-edge optimizers that can be used for virtually any mathematical 
    optimization task. These include full-batch gradient descent techniques, 
    small-batch techniques, gradient-free optimizers, and constrained optimization.
